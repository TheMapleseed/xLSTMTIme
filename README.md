# xLSTMTime: Temporal Models for Financial Time Series

This repository contains the LaTeX source file (`xlstm_time_architecture.tex`) detailing the mathematical architecture
       and implementation of the **xLSTMTime** model.

## Overview

**xLSTMTime** is an enterprise-grade implementation of the extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture, 
              specifically optimized for financial time series forecasting. 
   It builds upon the core xLSTM concepts proposed by Hochreiter et al. (2023) and adapts them for the complexities of financial markets.

The model aims to capture both long-range dependencies and sudden regime shifts common in financial data by integrating:

*   **Scalar LSTM (sLSTM):** Element-wise operations for efficient processing.
*   **Matrix LSTM (mLSTM):** Matrix operations for handling more complex patterns.
*   **Adaptive Selection Mechanism:** Dynamically chooses between sLSTM and mLSTM based on input data characteristics (e.g., volatility, complexity).
*   **Time Series Decomposition:** Separates input series into trend and seasonal components for specialized processing.

## Document Contents

The `xlstm_time_architecture.tex` document provides a comprehensive guide covering:

*   **Mathematical Foundations:** Detailed formulation of the general LSTM structure and the sLSTM/mLSTM extensions.
*   **Model Architecture:** Breakdown of the xLSTMTime components, including input/output transformations,
       normalization layers, and the parallel processing paths for trend and seasonal components.
*   **Forward Pass Algorithm:** Algorithmic description of the data flow.
*   **Adaptive Selection:** Criteria for dynamically switching between sLSTM and mLSTM.
*   **Implementation Details:** Considerations for production deployment, including:
    *   Java code examples for thread safety, lazy initialization, and error handling.
    *   Performance analysis (computational complexity, memory optimization, parallelization).
    *   Guidelines for data preprocessing, model configuration, and evaluation metrics.

## Usage

This document serves as a technical specification and theoretical reference for the xLSTMTime model. To view the formatted document, 
   compile `xlstm_time_architecture.tex` using a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
